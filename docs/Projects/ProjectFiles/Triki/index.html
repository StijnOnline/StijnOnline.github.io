			With Blightbound close to release, <a href="https://www.ronimo-games.com/">Ronimo Games</a> was in the pre-production phase for their next game
			but with limited time to research mechanics they assigned us (team of 6 as part of our studies, with me as the single programmer) to develop a  multiplayer dungeon crawler gameplay prototype and to experiment with unique ways to combine PvP and PvE.

			Triki! is a 4-player mini-royale dungeon crawler game filled with many monsters and a boss where players fight to be the last standing while the tide is coming in fast. Kill enemies to entertain the god of mischief, who created the dungeon, and she might offer a choice to become stronger. Download the game on

	<p class="TextBoxText Write">
		It was difficult to both experiment with unique mechanics while also delivering a polished prototype in one semester. The main unique mechanic is our win-condition combining PvP and PvE. The winner is the last Player alive but with one twist, the dungeon's boss needs to be defeated for that player to win. Players need to choose to co√∂perate for an easy fight with the boss and fight eachother later or kill eachother first but stand alone against the boss with limited resources.
