		<p class="Write">
			During my internship in 2021, I worked on a variety of things such as gameplay, networking and our control center app. Many tasks involved networking because they created a control center tablet app that needs full (wireless) control of all the gameserver's settings. I have added a lot of new functionality to this interface such as: configurable order of challenges with savable presets, a list of players for easy access with database connectivity, a reworked system for automatically  queueing games. I have also reworked some core systems such as the scoresystem and refactored a tool for easier editing of challenges, added a new mini-streak system and added autonomous network control for our dmx light installation.
